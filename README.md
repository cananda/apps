Configuration and help documentation for stuff I use / prototype.

Will need help from the community to improve configuration or when newer versions of the relevant software is available. This can then serve as best practices for implementation.

Feel free to open issues  or send me pull requests for changes.

Disclaimer: I'm not an expert. I evolve as I read and experiement. Occassionaly, I discuss with my peers and seek feedback. Use it at your own risk.
